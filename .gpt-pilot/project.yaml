development_plan:
- description: Set up the project structure, create a Node.js application with Express and initialize a Git repository. Also,
    establish linting and formatting standards using ESLint and Prettier.
  programmatic_goal: Run a Node.js application with Express that serves a `GET /ping` endpoint returning HTTP 200 and a 'pong'
    message. ESLint and Prettier must be configured with the standard style and no lint errors should be present in the initial
    commit.
  user_review_goal: When visiting `/ping`, the server responds with 'pong' and the initial commit code should adhere to the
    standard code style.
- description: Create and configure a MongoDB database with Mongoose, and set up a user authentication system using Passport.js
    with a simple User schema.
  programmatic_goal: Successfully connect to a MongoDB instance and authenticate a user using Passport.js with local strategy.
    Test endpoints /register and /login should be working with the ability to register a new user and login with its credentials.
  user_review_goal: Register a new user on `/register` and then log in with the same credentials on `/login`, ensuring user
    data is persisted correctly.
- description: Develop the data scraping module using Puppeteer and Cheerio for dynamic and static content respectively, including
    basic target URLs management.
  programmatic_goal: Write a module capable of scraping static content from a given URL using Cheerio and dynamic content
    using Puppeteer. Ensure scrapers handle a list of target URLs stored in the database and return scraped content.
  user_review_goal: Verify that the scraper can collect data from multiple static and dynamic target URLs and store them into
    the database.
- description: Implement the advanced targeting algorithm module that can select URLs based on provided keywords.
  programmatic_goal: Create an algorithm that takes keywords and identifies relevant URLs for scraping. The algorithm should
    be able to update the database with new targeted URLs based on keyword matches.
  user_review_goal: Ensure that the targeting algorithm recommends accurate URLs for a given set of keywords after a manual
    review.
- description: Design and implement a multilingual content scraping system that includes automatic language detection and
    language-specific crawling parameters.
  programmatic_goal: Implement functionality to detect the language of scraped content automatically and to apply different
    crawling parameters based on the detected language.
  user_review_goal: Confirm that the scraper successfully identifies the language of content and applies the correct crawling
    parameters for at least two different languages.
- description: Integrate TensorFlow.js for machine learning process optimization, such as refining scraping strategies and
    performance improvements.
  programmatic_goal: Use TensorFlow.js to create and train a simple model based on scraping results. The model should optimize
    the decision process of whether to continue scraping similar content.
  user_review_goal: Validate that the system uses machine learning feedback to adjust its scraping strategy, resulting in
    improved efficiency observable in performance metrics.
- description: Develop the customizable data processing and storage system to manage various data types with a scalable internal
    database, and external export features.
  programmatic_goal: Code a data processing system that formats, tags, and categorizes scraped content. Implement the database
    schemas using Mongoose for the various data types and establish export functionalities.
  user_review_goal: Ensure that the system can display formatted data, apply tags and categorization, and successfully export
    data to a specified external format.
- description: Create React frontend applications with React-Redux for state management and an intuitive, multilingual user
    interface using i18next.
  programmatic_goal: Develop a React application with Redux for state management, incorporate the i18next library for internationalization

  user_review_goal: Monitor app activities and errors to ensure that the logging is comprehensible and that the system responds
    gracefully to issues.
- description: Conduct final integration and compatibility checks, confirming everything works harmoniously, including API
    connections, data sync, and user functionality.
