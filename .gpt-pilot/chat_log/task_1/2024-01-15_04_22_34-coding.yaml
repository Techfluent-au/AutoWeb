  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

    ```\n\nCan you debug this issue or implement changes to comply with the additional user input?\n\nTell me all the new\
    \ code that needs to be written or modified to implement current task and have it fully working. You can count that the\
    \ environment is set up previously and packages listed in files are installed so tell me only commands needed for installation\
    \ of new dependencies, if there are any.\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about in which file should the new code go\
    \ to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever\
    \ a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split it into smaller files.\n\n\nYou do not need to make any\
    \ automated tests work.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nDo not tell me anything about setting up the database or anything OS related\
    \ - only if some dependencies need to be installed."

  content: "The error message that your colleague has sent indicates that the Node.js application could not find the `app.js`\
    \ file at the location `E:\\gpt-pilot\\workspace\\Workshop_Wizard\\workshop-wizard-web\\gpt-pilot\\workspace\\src\\app.js`.\
    \ Here are the steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. Confirm that the `app.js` file is in the correct directory\
    \ as mentioned in the error message. If it's not, either move it to the correct location or change the directory from\
    \ which you're trying to run the Node.js application.\n\n2. Another possibility is that the path provided in the command\
    \ prompt may be incorrect. Make sure to navigate to the correct directory where the `app.js` is located before running\
    \ the Node.js application.\n\n3. There might be a possibility of a typo in the file name. Check for any discrepancies\
    \ between the file name on disk and the file name in the error message.\n\nTo avoid similar issues in the future, you\
    \ can also introduce an npm script to start the server. Modify the `package.json` file by adding a start script:\n\n**/package.json**\n\
    ```json\n{\n  ...\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"node src/app.js\",\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\
    \" && exit 1\"\n  },\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nIf your colleague opens a command prompt and navigates to the root directory of\
    \ the AutoWeb project, they could use the following command to start the application, which should help avoid any absolute\
    \ path issues:\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nThis command will automatically use the relative path to the `app.js` file as\
    \ defined in the `package.json` scripts, reducing the chance of a `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error due to path issues.\n\nIf none\
    \ of the above resolves the issue, there might be a system-specific problem with the environment, file system, or permissions\
    \ that goes beyond the scope of provided files and instructions.\n\n**Note:** No additional installations or dependencies\
    \ are required since the error in question seems to be related to file system paths rather than missing Node dependencies,\
    \ and it is assumed that all mentioned packages are installed as per the instructions provided."
