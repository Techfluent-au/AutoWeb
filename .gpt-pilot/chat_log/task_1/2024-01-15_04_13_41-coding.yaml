  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

    We''ve broken the development of this app down to these tasks:

    ```

    1. Set up the project structure, create a Node.js application with Express and initialize a Git repository. Also, establish
    linting and formatting standards using ESLint and Prettier.


    2. Create and configure a MongoDB database with Mongoose, and set up a user authentication system using Passport.js with
    a simple User schema.


    3. Develop the data scraping module using Puppeteer and Cheerio for dynamic and static content respectively, including
    basic target URLs management.


    4. Implement the advanced targeting algorithm module that can select URLs based on provided keywords.


    5. Design and implement a multilingual content scraping system that includes automatic language detection and language-specific
    crawling parameters.


    6. Integrate TensorFlow.js for machine learning process optimization, such as refining scraping strategies and performance
    improvements.


    7. Develop the customizable data processing and storage system to manage various data types with a scalable internal database,
    and external export features.


    8. Create React frontend applications with React-Redux for state management and an intuitive, multilingual user interface
    using i18next.


    9. Implement the real-time dashboard with data analytics and reporting capabilities using Socket.io, Moment, Cron, and
    ECharts.


    10. Add the security, compliance, and data protection features using Helmet, jwt, bcrypt and ensure regular updates through
    Node-Cron.


    11. Develop integration features with GPT and other AI technologies for data analysis and summarization using Googleapis
    and custom AI modules.


    12. Set up collaboration tools within the app for project co-management and communication using Socket.io for real-time
    interaction.


    13. Implement comprehensive logging and error handling using Winston, Morgan, and custom middleware to provide a robust
    monitoring system.


    14. Conduct final integration and compatibility checks, confirming everything works harmoniously, including API connections,
    data sync, and user functionality.


    ```


    You are currently working on task #1 with the following description:

    ```

    Set up the project structure, create a Node.js application with Express and initialize a Git repository. Also, establish
    linting and formatting standards using ESLint and Prettier.

    ```


    After all the code is finished, a human developer will check if the app works this way - `When visiting `/ping`, the server
    responds with ''pong'' and the initial commit code should adhere to the standard code style.`


    Now, tell me all the code that needs to be written to implement ONLY this task and have it fully working and all commands
    that need to be run to implement this task.


    **IMPORTANT**

    When you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code
    in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split
    it into smaller files.


    **IMPORTANT**

    Remember, I created an empty folder where I will start writing files that you tell me and that are needed for this app.

    You do not need to make any automated tests work.


    DO NOT specify commands to create any folders or files, they will be created automatically - just specify the relative
    path to each file that needs to be written.


    Never use the port 5000 to run the app, it''s reserved.'

  content: "To complete task #1, we need to set up a couple of things:\n\n1. Initialize the project with a `package.json`\
    \ file.\n2. Set up the Express app.\n3. Initialize a Git repository and set up linting with ESLint and formatting with\
    \ Prettier.\n4. Create a simple endpoint that responds to `/ping` with 'pong'.\n\nLet\u2019s go through these steps in\
    \ detail with the necessary code and commands.\n\n**Initialize package.json**\nTo create the `package.json`, run this\
    \ command:\n```bash\nnpm init -y\n```\nThis command will create a `package.json` file with default values.\n\n**Set up\
    \ Express**\n1. Install Express:\n```bash\nnpm install express\n```\n\n2. Create an Express server in the `src/app.js`:\n\
    ```javascript\n// src/app.js\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst port = process.env.PORT\
    \ || 3000;\n\napp.get('/ping', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('pong');\n});\n\napp.listen(port, () => {\n  console.log(`Server\
    \ is listening on port ${port}`);\n});\n\nmodule.exports = app;\n```\n\n**Initialize Git repository**\nTo initialize a\
    \ Git repository, run this command:\n```bash\ngit init\n```\n\n**Set up linting with ESLint**\n1. Install ESLint:\n```bash\n\
    npm install eslint --save-dev\n```\n\n2. Initialize ESLint:\n```bash\nnpx eslint --init\n```\nFollow the prompts to create\
    \ a configuration file that fits the team\u2019s coding style criteria. For this exercise, we will choose a popular style\
    \ guide such as Airbnb.\n\n**Set up formatting with Prettier**\n1. Install Prettier:\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev\
    \ prettier\n```\n\n2. Optionally, to avoid conflicts between Prettier and ESLint, install the following packages:\n```bash\n\
    npm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier\n```\n\n3. Create a Prettier configuration file in\
    \ `.prettierrc`:\n```json\n// .prettierrc\n{\n    \"semi\": true,\n    \"trailingComma\": \"es5\",\n    \"singleQuote\"\
    : true,\n    \"printWidth\": 80,\n    \"tabWidth\": 2\n}\n```\n\n4. Update the ESLint configuration in `.eslintrc.js`\
    \ to include Prettier plugins:\n```javascript\n// .eslintrc.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  // ...other config\n  extends: [\n\
    \    // ...other extends\n    'plugin:prettier/recommended'\n  ],\n  plugins: [\n    // ...other plugins\n    'prettier'\n\
    \  ],\n  rules: {\n    // ... other rules\n    'prettier/prettier': ['error']\n  }\n};\n```\n\n**Create a `.gitignore`\
    \ file**\nAdd a `.gitignore` file to avoid tracking files and folders that are not relevant to the repository:\n```\n\
    // .gitignore\nnode_modules/\n.env\n*.log\n```\n\nRun the app with:\n```bash\nnode src/app.js\n```\n\nThe application\
    \ should now be accessible, and visiting `/ping` should return 'pong'.\n\nFinally, commit your changes:\n```bash\ngit\
    \ add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial project setup with Express server and linting\"\n```\n\nThe code should adhere to standard\
    \ style, and the repository will be ready to be reviewed by the human developer. When ready, they will visit `/ping`,\
    \ and the server response should be 'pong', indicating that the task is done from a programmatic perspective."
