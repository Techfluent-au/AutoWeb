    \ on task \"Set up the project structure, create a Node.js application with Express and initialize a Git repository. Also,\
    \ establish linting and formatting standards using ESLint and Prettier.\" and you have to focus only on that task.\n\n\
    \nA part of the app is already finished.Here are files that are currently implemented:\n\n**/package.json**\n```\n{\n\

    workshop-wizard-web\\gpt-pilot\\workspace\\AutoWeb\\src\\app.js\n  1:1  error  Parsing error: The keyword 'const' is reserved\n\
    \n\u2716 1 problem (1 error, 0 warnings)\n```\n\nCan you debug this issue or implement changes to comply with the additional\
    \ user input?\n\nTell me all the new code that needs to be written or modified to implement current task and have it fully\
    \ working. You can count that the environment is set up previously and packages listed in files are installed so tell\
    \ me only commands needed for installation of new dependencies, if there are any.\n\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nWhen you think about\
    \ in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code in more smaller\
    \ files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split it into smaller\
    \ files.\n\n\nYou do not need to make any automated tests work.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nDo not tell me anything about setting\
    \ up the database or anything OS related - only if some dependencies need to be installed."
response: "The error you're encountering suggests that ESLint is not parsing the JavaScript file according to the ECMAScript\
  \ version that supports the 'const' keyword. Since 'const' is a feature introduced in ES2015 (ES6), you need to make sure\
  \ that ESLint is set up to parse your code as ES6 or higher.\n\nHere's what you need to do to fix the ESLint parsing error:\n\
  \n1. Update the `.eslintrc.js` file to include a parser option that specifies the ECMAScript version, like so:\n\n```javascript\n\
  module.exports = {\n  \"parserOptions\": {\n    \"ecmaVersion\": 2020, // You can set this to 6 or higher (up to the latest\
  \ version, e.g., 2020)\n    \"sourceType\": \"module\",\n  },\n  \"extends\": [\n    \"eslint:recommended\",\n    \"plugin:prettier/recommended\"\
  \n  ],\n  \"plugins\": [\n    \"prettier\"\n  ],\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"prettier/prettier\": [\"error\"]\n  },\n  \"env\"\
  : {\n    \"es6\": true,\n    \"node\": true // Adds all of the Node.js global variables and Node.js scoping.\n  }\n};\n\
  ```\nThis tells ESLint to use the correct parser settings so that ES6 syntax such as 'const', 'let', arrow functions, etc.,\
  \ won't throw parsing errors.\n\n2. ESLint is set up correctly in the provided `.eslintrc.js` configuration, but if you\
  \ are using an environment that requires specific ECMAScript version settings, you should add them.\n\nConsidering the current\
  \ state of the `.eslintrc.js` and `package.json` files, no additional dependencies should be required. The ESLint configuration\
  \ must solely be updated to match the correct ES6+ environment.\n\nAfter updating the `.eslintrc.js` file accordingly, you\
  \ should be able to run `npx eslint src/` without encountering the previously mentioned error.\n\nAs for the rest of the\
  \ project structure, it is already modular, having separate configuration files and a single `app.js` initializing the Express\
  \ server. The current codebase should be maintainable as it grows, provided that each feature/module is added in separate\
  \ files and required into the main application as needed. This will keep the primary application file clean and focused\
  \ solely on server configuration and middleware management.\n\nEnsure to commit the changes and push them to the Git repository\
  \ to keep track of the project's versioning:\n\n```\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Update ESLint configuration\"\ngit push\
  \ origin main\n```\n\nThese commands add files to staging, commit the changes with a message, and push the changes to the\
  \ main branch in the repository. As the project grows, keep in mind to keep your commits atomic, and push regularly after\
  \ completing each significant change or feature implementation."
