  content: You are a full stack software developer who works in a software development agency. You write very modular and
    clean code. Your job is to implement tasks that your tech lead assigns you. Each task has a description of what needs
    to be implemented, a programmatic goal that will determine if a task can be marked as done and user-review goal that will
    determine if a task is done or not but from a user perspective since it will be reviewed by a human.

    \ files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split it into smaller\
    \ files.\n\n\nYou do not need to make any automated tests work.\n\n**IMPORTANT**\nDo not tell me anything about setting\

  content: "The error you're encountering suggests that ESLint is not parsing the JavaScript file according to the ECMAScript\
    \ version that supports the 'const' keyword. Since 'const' is a feature introduced in ES2015 (ES6), you need to make sure\
    \ that ESLint is set up to parse your code as ES6 or higher.\n\nHere's what you need to do to fix the ESLint parsing error:\n\
    \n1. Update the `.eslintrc.js` file to include a parser option that specifies the ECMAScript version, like so:\n\n```javascript\n\
    module.exports = {\n  \"parserOptions\": {\n    \"ecmaVersion\": 2020, // You can set this to 6 or higher (up to the latest\
    \ version, e.g., 2020)\n    \"sourceType\": \"module\",\n  },\n  \"extends\": [\n    \"eslint:recommended\",\n    \"plugin:prettier/recommended\"\
    \n  ],\n  \"plugins\": [\n    \"prettier\"\n  ],\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"prettier/prettier\": [\"error\"]\n  },\n  \"env\"\
    : {\n    \"es6\": true,\n    \"node\": true // Adds all of the Node.js global variables and Node.js scoping.\n  }\n};\n\
    ```\nThis tells ESLint to use the correct parser settings so that ES6 syntax such as 'const', 'let', arrow functions,\
    \ etc., won't throw parsing errors.\n\n2. ESLint is set up correctly in the provided `.eslintrc.js` configuration, but\
    \ if you are using an environment that requires specific ECMAScript version settings, you should add them.\n\nConsidering\
    \ the current state of the `.eslintrc.js` and `package.json` files, no additional dependencies should be required. The\
    \ ESLint configuration must solely be updated to match the correct ES6+ environment.\n\nAfter updating the `.eslintrc.js`\
    \ file accordingly, you should be able to run `npx eslint src/` without encountering the previously mentioned error.\n\
    \nAs for the rest of the project structure, it is already modular, having separate configuration files and a single `app.js`\
    \ initializing the Express server. The current codebase should be maintainable as it grows, provided that each feature/module\
    \ is added in separate files and required into the main application as needed. This will keep the primary application\
    \ file clean and focused solely on server configuration and middleware management.\n\nEnsure to commit the changes and\
    \ push them to the Git repository to keep track of the project's versioning:\n\n```\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Update\
    \ ESLint configuration\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\nThese commands add files to staging, commit the changes with a\
    \ message, and push the changes to the main branch in the repository. As the project grows, keep in mind to keep your\
    \ commits atomic, and push regularly after completing each significant change or feature implementation."

  content: 'Ok, now, take your previous message and convert it to actionable items. An item might be a code change or a command
    run. When you need to change code, make sure that you put the entire content of the file in the value of `content` key
    even though you will likely copy and paste the most of the previous message. The commands must be able to run on a Windows
    machine.


    **IMPORTANT**

    Within the file modifications, anything needs to be written by the user, add the comment in the same line as the code
    that starts with `// INPUT_REQUIRED {input_description}` where `input_description` is a description of what needs to be
    added here by the user. Just make sure that you put comments only inside files that support comments (e.g. not in JSON
    files).


    **IMPORTANT**

    When you want to add a comment that tells the user to add the previous implementation at that place, make sure that the
    comment starts with `[OLD CODE]` and add a description of what old code should be inserted here. For example, `[OLD CODE]
    Login route`.


    **IMPORTANT**

    When you think about in which file should the new code go to, always try to make files as small as possible and put code
    in more smaller files rather than in one big file. Whenever a file becomes too large (more than 50 lines of code) split
    it into smaller files.'
